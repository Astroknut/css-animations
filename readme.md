# CSS Transitions & Animations

## Objectives

- Understand keyframe animation
- Use CSS Transitions to animate elements
- Use CSS Animations to create detailed animations
- Describe the importance of prefixing CSS properties
- Compare & contrast using CSS and JS for animations

## Intro (5 minutes)

So far, we've used JavaScript and jQuery to make elements move around on our page. While easy to do, using JavaScript to animate our page will slow our page load times down in noticiable ways. It can also be messy to mix cosmetic code in with the core of your frontend functionality.

Luckily, CSS Animations allows us to handle animations where they belong - in the stylesheet! CSS Animations also have a much lower impact on page loads. 

## Concept (10 minutes)

CSS uses the same basic concepts used in hand-drawn animation - Keyframes:

![Keyframes!](http://www.utdallas.edu/atec/midori/Handouts/history_files/key_n_inbetween.jpg)

In the above image, the the left and right drawings are **Keyframes** - they define the starting or ending point of a smooth transition. The drawings between the left and right image are **Inbetweens** - they don't have to be drawn on a storyboard, because the animator can assume what will  happen inbetween keyframes.

In web-based animations, Keframes work the same way - the represent the begining or ending state of the element being animated. However, our Inbetweens will be generated by code, instead of filled in by hand later.

Let's take a look at the starter code in this repo. You'll find some beautifully designed CSS attached to the Index file, greeting you with a nice message. But there's a second design hiding in our file, that we can't yet see! We have to add the class .alt first.
Let's use a jquery toggleClass click function to add/remove the class on click:

```javascript
	$( "#greeting" ).click(function() {
	  $( "#greeting" ).toggleClass( "alt" );
	});	
```

**Transitions** let us tell the browser how to change a property over time. For
example, if the height of an element changes (due to a :hover selector, for
example), we can tell the browser to change the height gradually over 1 second.

**Animations** are similar to transitions, in that they let us have properties
change over time, but they give us more control over how those changes happen.
For example, we have more control over how the animation repeats, change between
multiple values at once, etc.

**Prefixing** - If you're using chrome, you won't need to prefix any properties
for this lesson, but in general, it's a good idea to check [Can I Use](caniuse.com)
to see if you need to use prefixes to support most users. For CSS Animations,
you should use prefixes to ensure support for Safari, IE, and other browsers.

The easiest way to do this is with [prefix free](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/).

### Bonuses

Look at the following examples, try to re-create them from scratch using as little
starter code as possible.

### CSS / JS Animations

CSS Animations are easy and mostly compatible, so they're often a good choice
for basic animation needs. For anything more complex, such as animation that
depends on user input, you'll need to use Javascript. There are good libraries
for animation, including jQuery UI, and [GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)](http://greensock.com/gsap)
